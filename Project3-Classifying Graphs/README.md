# LINGI2364-Project3_template
This repository contains the template provided for the third project of the UCLouvain course [LINGI2364 - Mining Patterns in Data](https://uclouvain.be/cours-2018-lingi2364).

This project consists in using and adapting an implementation of the gSpan graph mining algorithm in order to find frequent subgraphs in a labelled graph database and perform various classification tasks. The gSpan implementation was adapted from [here](https://github.com/betterenvi/gSpan).
